Getting path of photos::

uuid from Person object looks like..
    uuid:121aac7a-c2f6-4483-8e14-72938e2fa88a

needs to look like::
    uuid_121aac7a_c2f6_4483_8e14_72938e2fa88a

    replace ":" and "-"'s to "_"

regex call:: 
    new RegExp(r"([:,-])")

path will need to look like::
    assets/db/default/household_member/instances/uuid_121aac7a_c2f6_4483_8e14_72938e2fa88a/1606684293864_android_id_d588f4d267ed266f.jpg

"You can also use final manifestContent = await rootBundle.loadString('AssetManifest.json'); 
instead of DefaultAssetBundle if you want to do this in a place where you don't have a BuildContext. â€“ Javaxtreme Jul 21 at 0:37


    Future _initImages() async {
  // >> To get paths you need these 2 lines
  final manifestContent = await DefaultAssetBundle.of(context).loadString('AssetManifest.json');

  final Map<String, dynamic> manifestMap = json.decode(manifestContent);
  // >> To get paths you need these 2 lines

  final imagePaths = manifestMap.keys
      .where((String key) => key.contains('images/'))
      .where((String key) => key.contains('.svg'))
      .toList();

  setState(() {
    someImages = imagePaths;
